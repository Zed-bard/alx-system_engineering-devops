## Description

This distributed web infrastructure reduces primary server traffic by utilizing a load balancer to distribute the load between a primary and a replica server.

## Specifics About This Infrastructure

+ **Load Balancer Algorithm:** Configured with *Round Robin*, distributing workload equally among servers based on their weights.

+ **Load Balancer Setup:** Enables an *Active-Passive* configuration, where one server is active while the other is on standby.

+ **Database *Primary-Replica* Cluster:** Primary server handles read/write, while the replica processes read requests, ensuring data synchronization.

+ **Difference Between *Primary* and *Replica* Nodes:** Primary manages write operations, while the replica handles read operations, reducing traffic to the primary node.

## Issues With This Infrastructure

+ **SPOF (Single Point Of Failure):** Multiple potential points of failure, including the primary MySQL database, load balancer server, and application server.

+ **Security Concerns:** Lack of SSL encryption for transmitted data, posing a risk of unauthorized access. No firewall in place to block unauthorized IPs.

+ **Monitoring Absence:** No server monitoring, hindering awareness of server statuses and potential issues.
