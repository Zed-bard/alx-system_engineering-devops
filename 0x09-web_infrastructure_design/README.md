# 0x09. Web infrastructure design
**Web Infrastructure Design**
Web infrastructure design refers to the planning, configuration, and setup of various components and technologies that form the backbone of a web application or website. It involves designing a robust, scalable, secure, and efficient system to ensure the reliable delivery of content and services over the internet. 

Key elements of web infrastructure design typically include:

1. **Network Architecture**: This involves designing the network layout, including routers, switches, and other networking devices, to ensure efficient data transmission between servers, clients, and other components.

2. **Server Configuration**: Determining the number of servers needed, their specifications, and how they will be configured to handle incoming requests. This may include web servers, application servers, database servers, and caching servers.

3. **Load Balancing**: Implementing load balancers to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers, improving performance, scalability, and reliability.

4. **Database Design**: Planning the database structure, including data storage, indexing, and replication strategies, to efficiently manage and retrieve data.

5. **Security Measures**: Implementing security protocols, firewalls, encryption, and other measures to protect the infrastructure from cyber threats, data breaches, and unauthorized access.

6. **Monitoring and Logging**: Setting up monitoring tools and logging mechanisms to track system performance, detect anomalies, and troubleshoot issues proactively.

7. **Scalability and High Availability**: Designing the infrastructure to easily scale resources up or down based on demand and ensuring high availability to minimize downtime and ensure uninterrupted service.

8. **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**: Utilizing CDNs to cache and deliver static content closer to end-users, reducing latency and improving performance.

9. **Disaster Recovery**: Implementing backup and disaster recovery plans to mitigate the impact of system failures, data loss, or natural disasters.

10. **Compliance and Regulations**: Ensuring compliance with relevant laws, regulations, and industry standards, such as GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI DSS, depending on the nature of the application and data being handled.

Overall, effective web infrastructure design requires careful planning, consideration of various factors such as performance, security, scalability, and reliability, and continuous optimization to meet the evolving needs of the application and its users.

## Requirements

### General

- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- For each task, once you are done whiteboarding (on a whiteboard, piece of paper or software or your choice), take a picture/screenshot of your diagram
- This project will be manually reviewed:
  - As each task is completed, the name of that task will turn green
  - Upload a screenshot, showing that you completed the required levels, to any image hosting service (I personally use imgur but feel free to use anything you want).
  - For the following tasks, insert the link from of your screenshot into the answer file
- After pushing your answer file to GitHub, insert the GitHub file link into the URL box
- You will also have to whiteboard each task in front of a mentor, staff or student - no computer or notes will be allowed during the whiteboarding session
- Focus on what you are being asked:
  - Cover what the requirements mention, we will explore details in a later project
  - Keep in mind that you will have 30 minutes to perform the exercise, you will get points for what is asked in requirements
  - Similarly in a job interview, you should answer what the interviewer asked for, be careful about being too verbose - always ask the interviewer if going into details is necessary - speaking too much can play against you
- In this project, again, avoid going in details if not asked
