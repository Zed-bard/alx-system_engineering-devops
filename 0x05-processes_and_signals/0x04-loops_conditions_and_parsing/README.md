# 0x04. Loops, conditions and parsing

## Background Context
This project covers various concepts related to loops, conditions, and parsing in Bash scripting.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
- How to create SSH keys
- What is the advantage of using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` over `#!/bin/bash`
- How to use `while`, `until`, and `for` loops
- How to use `if`, `else`, `elif`, and `case` condition statements
- How to use the `cut` command
- What are file and other comparison operators, and how to use them

## Requirements
### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- All your Bash script files must be executable
- You are not allowed to use `awk`
- Your Bash script must pass Shellcheck (version 0.7.0) without any error
- The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what the script is doing

Man or help pages:
- `env`: The `env` command is used to display or modify the environment variables in Unix-like operating systems. It can be used to run a command in a modified environment or print the current environment.

- `cut`: The `cut` command is used to extract specific sections (columns) from a file or input stream. It allows you to specify delimiters and field positions to separate and extract the desired data.

- `for`: The `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence of values or elements. It allows you to perform a set of commands repeatedly, with each iteration using a different value from the specified sequence.

- `while`: The `while` loop is used to execute a set of commands repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true. It evaluates the condition before each iteration and continues looping until the condition becomes false.

- `until`: The `until` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but it executes a set of commands repeatedly until a specified condition becomes true. It evaluates the condition before each iteration and continues looping until the condition becomes true.

- `if`: The `if` statement is used to perform conditional execution of commands. It allows you to check a condition and execute different sets of commands based on whether the condition is true or false.
