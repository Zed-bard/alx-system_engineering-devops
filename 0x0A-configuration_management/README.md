# Skynet Auto-Remediation Tool

## Background Context

During my time at SlideShare, I developed Skynet, an auto-remediation tool designed to monitor, scale, and fix Cloud infrastructure issues. Skynet utilized a parallel job-execution system called MCollective, allowing me to execute commands across one or multiple servers simultaneously. With MCollective, I could apply actions to selected sets of servers based on criteria such as hostname or other metadata.

However, an unfortunate bug in the code caused unexpected behavior. Sending a nil argument to MCollective's filter method resulted in unintended consequences:
- MCollective interpreted nil as a directive to apply the action to all servers.
- The action I initiated was to terminate selected servers.

This bug led to a significant disruption in SlideShare's document conversion environment, with 75% of conversion infrastructure servers being shut down. This resulted in users being unable to convert their documents, including PDFs, PowerPoints, and videos.

Thanks to Puppet, we were able to swiftly restore our infrastructure within an hour. Puppet automated the process of launching servers, configuring them, importing application code, starting processes, and fixing bugs, significantly reducing downtime.

While writing Puppet code requires upfront investment, its benefits in automating and maintaining complex infrastructure are undeniable.
