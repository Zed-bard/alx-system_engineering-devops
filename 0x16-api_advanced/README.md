# API Advance

The main target of the project is to learn how to use the Reddit API.
## Learning Objectives

- **API Proficiency**: Enhance skills in working with APIs, particularly the Reddit API, by performing tasks such as querying endpoints and parsing JSON results.
- **Technical Interviews**: Prepare for common API-related interview questions to confidently handle technical interviews.
- **Recursive Functions**: Utilize recursive functions to handle API pagination and sort dictionary values.
- **Coding Standards**: Follow best practices in Python scripting, including PEP 8 style and organized imports, while adhering to the project's coding requirements.

This project aims to equip participants with the necessary knowledge and skills to efficiently use APIs and improve their coding proficiency for professional development.

# Requirements
## General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- Libraries imported in your Python files must be organized in alphabetical order
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc
- All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- You must use the Requests module for sending HTTP requests to the Reddit API


## Tests :heavy_check_mark:

* [tests](./tests): Folder of test files for all tasks. Provided by ALX.

## Function Prototypes :floppy_disk:

Prototypes for functions written in this project:

| File           | Prototype                               |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `0-subs.py`    | `def number_of_subscribers(subreddit)`  |
| `1-top_ten.py` | `def top_ten(subreddit)`                |
| `2-recurse.py` | `def recurse(subreddit, hot_list=[])`   |
| `100-count.py` | `def count_words(subreddit, word_list)` |

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. How many subs?**
  * [0-subs.py](./0-subs.py): Python function that returns the total number of
  subscribers for a given subreddit.
  * Returns `0` if an invalid subreddit is given.

* **1. Top Ten**
  * [1-top_ten.py](./1-top_ten.py): Python function that prints the top ten
  hottest posts for a given subreddit.
  * Prints `None` if an invalid subreddit is given.

* **2. Recurse it!**
  * [2-recurse.py](./2-recurse.py): Python function that recursively returns a
  list of titles for all hot articles on a given subreddit.
  * Returns `None` if no results are found on the given subreddit.

* **3. Count it!**
  * [100-count.py](./100-count.py): Python function that recursively prints a
  sorted count of given keywords parsed from titles of all hot articles on a given
  subreddit.
  * Keywords are case-insensitive and delimited by spaces.
  * Results are printed in descending order by count.
  * Words with identical counts are sorted alphabetically.
  * Words with no matches are skipped.
  * Results are based on the number of times a keyword appears - ie.,
  `java java java` counts as three separate instances of `java`.`
