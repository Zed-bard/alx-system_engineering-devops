## Project Overview

This project focuses on understanding processes and signals in Linux. By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without the help of Google:

### General

- **PID (Process ID):** Understanding the concept of Process ID and how it is used to uniquely identify processes in Linux.

- **Process:** Knowledge of what a process is and its significance in the Linux operating system.

- **Finding Process PID:** Ability to find the Process ID of a running process using tools like `ps`, `pgrep`, and others.

- **Killing a Process:** Understanding how to terminate or kill a running process using various commands, including `kill` and `pkill`.

- **Signals:** Knowledge of signals in Linux and their role in process communication and control.

- **Unignorable Signals:** Identification of the two signals that cannot be ignored by a process.

## Instructions

Ensure that all Bash scripts are created and organized appropriately. Make sure they are executable and pass Shellcheck without errors. The `README.md` file should provide a comprehensive overview of the project, its requirements, and the learning objectives.
